## About The Project

Welcome! This repository contains a collection of exercises based on the Udemy course "Modern HTML & CSS From The Beginning (Including Sass)" by Brad Traversy. The course was last updated in March 2022, and the exercises included here aim to reinforce key concepts of modern HTML5, CSS3, and Sass, covering topics such as semantic markup, Flexbox, CSS Grid, responsive design, and preprocessors.

Each exercise is structured to provide hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and Sass, following best practices in modern front-end development.
